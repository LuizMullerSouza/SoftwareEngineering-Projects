# üìö Software Engineering Projects

Welcome to my repository! üëã

Here you will find a collection of projects I've developed throughout my Software Engineering degree at UNIGRAN. This space documents my learning process and evolution during these years of my journey. My goal is to share code, knowledge, logic, and, above all, the drive to progress.

Everything here represents projects developed along this great journey, from the first steps with a "Hello, World!" to more elaborate code. Feel free to explore, extract every possible piece of content, and perhaps see your own logic soar along the way!

## üß≠ What to Find in Each Section?

To make navigation easier, the repository is organized by semesters and subjects. Here's what to expect in each folder:

### üéì 1st Semester

* **`algorithms-i/` (Algorithms I):**
    * Introduction to algorithms.
    * Calculation and data processing concepts.
    * Conditional Structures: `if`/`else`, nested `if`, `switch`/`case` (using pseudocode/Portugol).
    * Repetition Structures: `while`, `do`/`while` (`repeat`), `for`.
    * Homogeneous Compound Variables: Arrays (`vectors`) and matrices.
    * And, of course, plenty of programming logic!

* **`programming-lab-i/` (Programming Lab I):**
    * Introduction to the C language.
    * Basic concepts: calculation and data processing.
    * Conditional Structures: `if`, `else`, `else if`, `switch case`.
    * Repetition Structures: `while`, `do while`, `for`.
    * Manipulation of Homogeneous Compound Variables: Arrays (`vectors`) and matrices.

*(Sections for upcoming semesters will be added as the course progresses).*
