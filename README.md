# üìö Software Engineering Projects

Welcome to my repository! üëã

Here you will find a collection of projects I've developed throughout my Software Engineering degree at UNIGRAN. This space documents my learning process and evolution during these years of my journey. My goal is to share code, knowledge, logic, and, above all, the drive to progress.

Everything here represents projects developed along this great journey, from the first steps with a "Hello, World!" to more elaborate code. Feel free to explore, extract every possible piece of content, and perhaps see your own logic soar along the way!

    * Introduction to algorithms.
    * Use of pseudocode in portugol.
    * Calculation and data processing concepts.
    * Conditional Structures: `se`/`senao`, `se aninhado`, `escolha`.
    * Repetition Structures: `enquanto`, `repita`, `para`.
    * Homogeneous Compound Variables: `vetor` and `matriz`.

* **`programming-lab-i/` (Programming Lab I):**
    * Introduction to the C language.
    * Basic concepts: calculation and data processing.
    * Conditional Structures: `if`, `else`, `if nested`, `switch case`.
    * Repetition Structures: `while`, `do while`, `for`.
    * Manipulation of Homogeneous Compound Variables: `vectors` and `matrices`.

### üéì 2nd Semester

### üìù Notes and Usage Information

All code within this repository was designed and structured based on my own logic during my learning process. However, feel free to download and modify it as you wish for your own studies.

Each major section corresponding to a course subject will contain its own `README.md` file, providing specific instructions on how to download and use those particular files, such as necessary software and step-by-step compilation instructions.
